We saw, that NestJS provide main goal to create easy back-end based on `ExpressJS` or `Fastify` solutions which can make
lots of troubles at productivity and callback times. That's why we focus on productivity and small callback times even 
at basic setups. Furthermore, we want to add Vue 3 supporting for some visual element's (ex. creating Admin page or 
creating custom OpenAPI visual documentation).
